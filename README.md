Telegram Product Availability Bot ü§ñ
A powerful and extendable Telegram bot that monitors e-commerce product pages for availability and sends instant notifications when an item is back in stock.

This bot is designed to run 24/7, using a persistent database to ensure that no monitored products are lost on restart. It leverages a headless browser for accurate scraping and provides a seamless user experience through Telegram.

## Features
üõçÔ∏è Multi-Product Monitoring: Track multiple product URLs simultaneously.

üìç Pincode Specific: Checks availability for a specific delivery pincode provided by the user.

‚è∞ Scheduled Checks: Uses a cron job to check for stock at configurable intervals.

üîî Instant Rich Notifications: Get alerts on Telegram with inline "Buy Now" and "Stop Monitoring" buttons.

üíæ Persistent Storage: Uses MongoDB Atlas to store all monitored products, ensuring data safety and persistence.

üåê Web Dashboard: Includes a simple Express.js web server to display project information and status.

ü§ñ Robust Scraping: Built with Puppeteer to handle modern, JavaScript-heavy websites.

Resilient by Design: Includes a notification queue and rate-limiting to handle API errors and prevent spam.

## Architecture Overview
The application is designed with a clear separation of concerns, making it modular and scalable.

[User] <--> [Telegram] <--> [Node.js Bot Server (Background Worker)]
                                |
                                +-----> [Scheduler (node-cron)] ---> [Web Scraper (Puppeteer)] ---> [Product Website]
                                |
                                +-----> [MongoDB Atlas (Database)]
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

A Telegram account

A free MongoDB Atlas account

Git

## Installation & Local Setup
Follow these steps to get your bot running on your local machine.

Clone the Repository

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
Install Dependencies

Bash

npm install
Create a Telegram Bot

Open Telegram and chat with the @BotFather.

Use the /newbot command to create a new bot.

BotFather will give you a token. Copy this token.

Set up MongoDB Atlas

Create a free (M0) cluster on MongoDB Atlas.

Create a database user and save the password.

In "Network Access," add your current IP address and 0.0.0.0/0 (Allow Access from Anywhere).

Get your connection string (Connect -> Drivers).

Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the project. You can copy the .env.example file if one exists.

Add your credentials to the .env file.

## Running the Application
For Development (with auto-restart):

Bash

npm run dev
For Production:

Bash

npm start
## Bot Commands
/start - Initializes the bot and displays a welcome message.

/help - Shows a detailed list of commands and examples.

/monitor <URL> [PINCODE] - Starts monitoring a product. The pincode is optional.

/stop <URL> [PINCODE] - Stops monitoring a product for a specific pincode.

/status - Shows a list of all products you are currently monitoring.

## Deployment
This application is designed to run 24/7. It is recommended to deploy it on a platform that supports long-running background processes.

Recommended Platform: Fly.io offers a generous "free allowance" that can host this bot at no cost.

Advanced Option: A self-managed VM, such as the Oracle Cloud Free Tier, provides the most powerful free resources but requires manual setup with a process manager like PM2.

When deploying, you should run the application as two separate processes for best performance:

Web Service: Runs index.js to serve the dashboard. (npm run start:web)

Background Worker: Runs worker.js to operate the bot and scheduler. (npm run start:worker)
